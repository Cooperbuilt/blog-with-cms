My dad builds model ships. When I say model ships, I don't mean small plastic ones. I mean 4 foot tall replicas of Spanish Galleons and famous fishing schooners. Each ship is lovingly crafted, plank by plank, rope by rope, until it is finally encased in glass to be displayed proudly on a mantle. 

Yesterday I was in my living room and for some reason, I fixated on one of the ship models. This ship, the "Blue Nose", is a replica of a Canadian schooner that my grandfather used to watch race into Gloucester harbor as a kid. My father built it for me to always remember the legend that was my "Pepe". 

I got up close. There are thousands of ropes intricately woven between and around each other. Six masts raise up 12 different sails - each bound by an elaborate web of rope, wood, and tar.

I was struck by the complexity. It boggled my mind that a human could design such a thing. I lamented my lack of focus and vision. I lamented our generations lack of focus. I thought - "how could I ever create something so complex, so perfectly purpose-built". 

My mind immediately turned to my technical abilities as a software engineer. 

A wave of anxiety washed over me. I compared myself to these titans of design that must have dreamt up this creation. I came up wanting. I thought about how much more I should study and practice in the hopes I could capture even a rough facsimile of their mastery. Maybe I could build something so perfect some day. Before that day, though, I would be "less than". This noise continued for some time until I noted an interesting detail in the model that changed how I saw the entire picture.

I've recently been struggling mightily with imposter syndrome. My role has been less execution-based of late, and I woke up recently convinced I had lost my abilities. 

I looked at a few engineers whom I respect. They have mastery over subject matter that I do not know. They produce interesting side projects. They output seemingly endless streams of work. 

In response to this introspection, I created a long list of all the things these engineers must know and be able to do. It became an archetype for me. As soon as I put it down on paper, it also created a cognitive dissonance that resonated throughout my life. 

I looked at the paper and couldn't help but feel a bit of despair. "I am so far off of this". 

My only response was to start studying and practicing in my off hours to try and make up the difference. I spent a ton of hours on my nights and weekends. I stopped writing blog posts. I actually stopped doing most things I enjoyed. 

I was spending all of this time "learning" - but a funny thing was happening. I wasn't getting any closer to that goal written so clearly on paper. 

I started to notice I wasn't even assimilating the knowledge. I was going through the motions of learning and practice to try and get to that goal on paper. 

I wasn't even enjoying the process. The returns were diminishing over time. I was spending more hours to "learn" less. It became a wrote task when learning and exploring new tech and new ideas used to be something that gave me immense joy.

I had sucked the joy out of my joyful activity by focusing only on the end. It was only when I noticed that tiny detail on the model ship did my perspective improve - and my happiness along with it.

Yes, this ship is immensely complex and was the top of its craft at the time. Looking at it from the outside, you can become overwhelmed by the knowledge and mastery. Just like that "paper engineer" I built to compare myself against.

I looked more closely and saw something fascinating. I followed the ropes from the sails down to the ship deck. They were all so perfectly intertwined...until they reached the deck. At spaced intervals, there were these posts that operated as repositories for all the rope ends in that area.

All of these ropes were tied wantonly around the posts with almost no rhyme or reason it seemed. The rope ends were an afterthought. A flaw. 

I sat for a minute and thought about how that could possibly have happened. How did these master creators forget to plan for the end of the ropes? How could they design such an ugly and in-elegant end? 

Thats the point. They didn't. 

These ships weren't designed in a vacuum. They weren't ideated out of thin air. __They were a version, not a conclusion.__

Before it was a schooner it was a one-masted sloop. Before that, a one-sailed barge. Before that an oared boat piloted only near the shoreline. 

Each one of these versions was purpose-built and effective at it's given task. Each version was outgrown by need and/or circumstance. Each version was an iteration of previous input, not newly designed from scratch every time. 

Which one was perfect? Was only the final schooner perfect in all it's many-sailed glory? Was the row boat perfect, with its simplicity and ability to move in calm winds? Was the very first raft perfect in its initial mastery of people over the waters? 

They were all perfect. They were all flawed. Just like that "paper engineer". There is no such thing. 

Trying to study or practice only to match up to some "perfect example" misses the point. Those perfect examples were only derived from a commitment to practice. Each of the extra sails and ropes was put there because a problem was faced or an opportunity was found in the daily practice. 

In an instant, the "paper engineer" goals changed. Instead of "master node.js", it was "practice node.js every day". Instead of "know webpack inside and out", it became "consistently delve into webpack documentation like an explorer would enter a jungle". 

The practice became the point. 

Ok Yes - this entire blog post is a very roundabout way of saying "enjoy the process, not the destination" which has to be one of the most overused tropes of all time. I'm sorry it took me this long to get you there. But like many platitudes and "universal truths", it often takes a life event to internalize them no matter how many times you hear them, 

For me, it was looking at this incredibly beautiful, complicated, flawed, tangled ship and realizing you can either see the complexity and lament your shortcomings - or start sailing and find out what ropes, sails, and masts you can add along the way.
