My dad builds model ships. When I say model ships, I don't mean small plastic ones. I mean 4 foot tall replicas of Spanish Galleons and famous fishing schooners. Each ship is lovingly crafted, plank by plank, rope by rope, until it is finally encased in glass to be displayed proudly on a mantle. 

Yesterday I was in my living room and for some reason, I fixated on one of the ship models in my living room. This ship, the "Blue Nose", is a replica of a Canadian schooner that my grandfather used to watch race into Gloucester harbor as a kid. My father built it for me to always remember the legend that was my "Pepe". 

I got up close. There are thousands of ropes intricately woven between and around each other. Six masts raise up 12 different sails - each bound by an elaborate web of rope, wood, and tar.

I was struck by the complexity. It boggled my mind that a human could design such a thing. I lamented my lack of focus and vision. I lamented our generations lack of focus. I thought - "how could we even build something so complex, so perfectly purpose-built". 

My mind immediately turned to my technical abilities as a software engineer. 

A wave of anxiety washed over me. I compared myself to these titans of design that must have dreamt up this creation. I came up wanting. I thought about how much more I should study and practice in the hopes I could capture even a rough facsimile of their mastery. Maybe I could build something so perfect some day. Before that day, though, I would be less than. This noise continued for some time. Until I noted an interesting detail in the model that changed how I saw the entire picture.
