  Have you ever looked at something in awe and thought "how could a person every
  design such a thing"? We all have a tendency to look at finished products and
  see only their complexity and completeness. We should change that.

My dad builds model ships. When I say model ships, I don't mean small plastic ones. I mean 4 foot tall replicas of Spanish Galleons and famous fishing schooners. He crafts each ship, plank by plank, rope by rope, until it is finally encased in glass to live forever on a mantle. 

Yesterday I was in my living room and for some reason, I fixated on one of the ship models. This ship, the "Blue Nose", is a replica of a Canadian schooner that my grandfather used to watch race into Gloucester harbor as a kid. My father built it for me to always remember the legend that was my "Pepe". 

I got up close. There are thousands of ropes intricately woven between and around each other. Two masts raise up 6 different sails - each bound by an elaborate web of rope, wood, and tar.

The complexity struck me. It boggled my mind that a human could design such a thing. I lamented my lack of focus and vision. I lamented our generations lack of focus. I thought - "how could I ever create something so complex, so perfectly purpose-built". 

My mind immediately turned to my technical abilities as a software engineer. 

A wave of anxiety washed over me. I compared myself to these titans of design that must have dreamt up this creation. 

I came up wanting. 

I thought about how much more I should study and practice in the hopes I could capture even a rough facsimile of their mastery. Maybe I could build something so perfect some day. Before that day, though, I would be "less than". This noise continued for some time until I noted an interesting detail in the model that changed how I saw the entire picture.  

### There's an Imposter in our Midst

I've recently been struggling mightily with imposter syndrome. My role has been less execution-based of late, and I woke up recently convinced I had lost my abilities. 

I looked at a few engineers whom I respect. They have mastery over subject matter that I do not know. They produce interesting side projects. They output seemingly endless streams of work. 

In response to this introspection, I created a long list of all the things these engineers must know and be able to do. It became an archetype for me. As soon as I put it down on paper, it also created a cognitive dissonance that resonated throughout my life. 

I looked at the paper and couldn't help but feel a bit of despair - "I am so far off of this". 

My only response was to start studying and practicing in my off hours to try and make up the difference. I spent a ton of hours on my nights and weekends. I stopped writing blog posts. I actually stopped doing most things I enjoyed. 

I was spending all this time "learning" - but a funny thing was happening. I wasn't getting any closer to that goal written so clearly on paper. 

I started to notice I wasn't even assimilating the knowledge. I was going through the motions of learning and practice to try and get to that goal. I was waking up every day telling myself to practice to "be a master".

I wasn't even enjoying the process. I would end every learning session frustrated because I still wasn't where I felt I should be. 

The returns were diminishing over time. I was spending more hours to "learn" less. It became a wrote task when learning and exploring new tech and new ideas used to be something that gave me immense happiness.

I had sucked the joy out of what used to be my most joyful activity by focusing only on the end. 

Then I saw that tiny detail on the model ship that stopped me in my tracks, and set me on a new path. 

### Seeing Beyond the Complexity

Yes, this ship is immensely complex and was the top of its craft at the time. Looking at it from the outside, you can become overwhelmed by the knowledge and mastery. Just like that "paper engineer" I built to compare myself against.

I looked more closely and saw something fascinating though. I followed the ropes from the sails downwards. 

They were all so perfectly intertwined...until they reached the deck. At spaced intervals, there were these posts that operated as repositories for all the rope ends in that area.

All of the ropes were tied wantonly around the posts with almost no rhyme or reason it seemed. The rope ends were an afterthought. A flaw. 

I sat for a minute and thought about how that could possibly have happened. How did these master creators forget to plan for the end of the ropes? How could they design such an ugly and in-elegant end? 

Thats the point. They didn't. 

These ships weren't designed in a vacuum. They weren't ideated out of thin air. __They were a version, not a conclusion.__

Before it was a schooner it was a one-masted sloop. Before that, a one-sailed barge. Before that an oared boat piloted only near the shoreline. 

Each one of these versions was purpose-built and effective at it's given task. Each version was outgrown by need and/or circumstance. Each version was an iteration of previous input, not newly designed from scratch every time. 

Which one was perfect? Was only the final schooner perfect in all it's many-sailed glory? Was the row boat perfect, with its simplicity and ability to move in calm winds? Was the very first raft perfect in its initial conquering of the waters? 

They were all perfect. They were all flawed. Just like that "paper engineer". There is no such thing. 

Trying to study or practice only to match up to some "perfect example" misses the point. Those "perfect examples" aren't statues, they're snapshots. 

For the "paper engineer", the skills and abilities are products of daily practice in technology and problem spaces I am not exposed to. 

For our ships, each sails and rope ended up there because a problem or opportunity arose out the daily practice of sailing. 

In an instant, the goals changed. Instead of "master node.js" it was "practice node.js every day". Instead of "know webpack inside and out" it became "consistently delve into webpack documentation like an explorer would enter a jungle". 

The practice became the point. 

When your goal is to "be the best at <X>" or "build the best <Y>", every practice session / working block only serves as a reminder for how far away you are from that conclusion. You can never know how much practice it will take to finally reach that goal. You don't control your destiny.  

When your goal is to "practice <X> to the best of my ability", you can get a win every single time you put your mind to it. You hold your destiny right in your hand. 

Thats a good feeling. 

Ok yes, you got me. This entire blog post is a very roundabout way of saying "enjoy the process, not the product". This is an overused trope. I'm sorry it took me this long to get you there. But like many platitudes and "universal truths", it often takes a life event to internalize them no matter how many times you hear them. 

For me, it was looking at this incredibly beautiful, complicated, flawed, tangled ship and realizing you can either see the complexity and lament your shortcomings - or start sailing and find out what ropes, sails, and masts you can add along the way.
