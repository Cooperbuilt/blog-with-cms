My last blog post was January, 2021. I've started a lot of drafts and jotted down a lot of ideas, but I stopped writing every day. When the daily writing habit stopped, the published posts stopped. 

I'd like that to change, so I'm breaking the seal. Let this count as my first blog post in over 4 months. It's not a good one, but that's not the point. I just need to get started again. 

Let this also be a reminder for one of your good habits that drifted away over the last difficult year. 

Start it again. Yes, you will likely do it badly. It's ok.
