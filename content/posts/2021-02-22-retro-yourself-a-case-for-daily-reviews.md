In the book "Atomic Habits", author James Clear talks about the power of the "1% rule".  This is a daily commitment to continuous improvement that yields surprising results. 

In his book, Clear uses some simple math to show that a daily 1% improvement produces a 37x improvement over a year. 

I know I want to be 37x better than I am now. That sounds awesome.

But continuous improvement is hard. Habits are hard. What do I even improve?

The secret to unlocking this daily continuous improvement is observation. 

### A quick story of failure.

I'll speak for myself here. When I hear about these improvement techniques, I tend to run at them full-force. With continuous improvement, I did the same. I made a list of all the things I wanted to improve (it was long) and carried it around with me. I did my best to be better at every one of them.

It didn't last, and it took me a while to figure out why.

I wasn't working on the right things. I actually still haven't figured out exactly what the right things are either. That's O.K. 

I went back to the drawing board and asked myself a question. How could I approach continuous improvement from first principles? The answer?
