TODO:
1. What does a daily review look like
2. Continous improvement is about small wins, not big committements
3. The structure of a daily review
4. Figuring out what to improve

In the book "Atomic Habits", author James Clear talks about the power of the "1% rule".  This is a daily commitment to continuous improvement that yields surprising results. 

In his book, Clear uses some simple math to show that a daily 1% improvement produces a 37x improvement over a year. 

I know I want to be 37x better than I am now. That sounds awesome.

But continuous improvement is hard. Habits are hard. What do I even improve?

The secret to unlocking this daily continuous improvement is observation. 

### A quick story of failure.

I'll speak for myself here. When I hear about these improvement techniques, I tend to run at them full-force. With continuous improvement, I did the same. I made a list of all the things I wanted to improve (it was long) and carried it around with me. I did my best to be better at every one of them.

It didn't last, and it took me a while to figure out why.

I wasn't working on the right things. I actually still haven't figured out exactly what the right things are either. That's O.K. 

I went back to the drawing board and asked myself a question. How could I approach continuous improvement from first principles? 

### Starting from the Basics
To improve is to advance towards a desired goal in some way. Without the goal in mind, changing habits or behaviors isn't technically improvement, it's movement (there's a big difference in a few letters there).

**Our first principle of continuous improvement must then be clearly defined goals.**

Improvement connotes measurement. It's an implicit truth in the word improvement that we have a measurement of our current ability in a thing, and we note an increase in that ability. 

**Our second principle of continuous improvement must then be an accurate measure of our current ability to execute on our defined goals**

Finally, in order to improve you must have some framework or understanding of the things that make up a successful embodiment of the goal you are striving for. This is critical. Defining a paragon of your goal gives you the chance to deconstruct what it is they do, and derive behaviors / activities / skills to work on to improve towards your goal. 

**Our third principle of continuous improvement must then be a definition of what success looks like, and a breakdown of the behaviors / abilities / knowledge etc that make up that success**

### How to Get Started
We have three things to figure out: our goals, our current ability level in each goal, and what makes up success in each goal.

This doesn't have to be an exhaustive deep-dive or a years-long soul search. It can (and should) be back-of-the-envelope in spirit. Here's an example:

Goal: I want to be a competitive powerlifter (total over 1600lbs) before the age of 35. 

Current Ability: I have a decent diet, excellent gym consistency, and suffer frequent injuries. 

What success looks like: A measured diet within +-100 target calories per day, daily mobility work for injury prevention, and increased volume in each gym session. 

There is an infinite amount of complexity around this (and any) goal. I could spend weeks listing all off all the possible inputs and outputs here. Thats not the point. You want to improve tomorrow. You want to improve today.

Follow these steps: 
1. Define your goal. 
2. Gut-check where you are with it. 
3. Define what success looks like as related to your current abilities. 

### Continuously Improving
You now have a set of goals and a set of things to make you better at those goals. The hard part is over. 

Here's where the daily review comes in. The concept is simple, start each day writing down your goals so you see them and reinforce them every day. End each day with a 5 minute retrospective. Look at each goal. Look at your definition of success in that goal. Look at your day. 

Identify one thing you could have done differently to emulate success. 

Here's an example. 

Before bed, I always eat cottage cheese and blueberries. The cottage cheese is a great long-lasting protein to keep me satiated throughout the night. Over time though, I've grown sick of the cottage cheese. I added blueberries. This isn't bad, but it's sugar before bad and that's not great for sleeping. Worryingly, I recently started adding brown sugar to sweeten in up. 

During my daily review last night, I looked at my goal of becoming a competitive powerlifter. I know success means an ideal, disciplined diet. My continuous improvement was then "remove sugar from cottage cheese from now on". 

The next day when I woke up, I wrote down my goals and my continuous improvmenet committment. When I was about to add sugar to my cottage cheese... I didn't. That was a 1% improvement. Do that every day and you will build great results
