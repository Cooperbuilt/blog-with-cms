  There's a stigma around engineers that push for promotions and raises. Phrases
  like "greedy", "peter principle" and "business-minded" get thrown around
  pejoratively. I have a different take.

It was 10pm on a Sunday night. My performance "self review" was due to my manager in 2 hours. I hadn't written a single line. A voice inside me said "you messed up...again", but another voice (the one I liked a lot more) said "you'll be fine, you do your job well and management sees that". Which of these two voices do you think ended up being right?

If you are a developer in any kind of corporate hierarchy, you're no stranger to performance reviews. We all do them a bit differently, but they all boil down to the same pieces: 

1. Try and remember at least half of the things you accomplished over the past x months. 
2. Do your best to shoe-horn those accomplishments into some provided framework of what success looks like at your position.
3. Cross your fingers and hit submit, hoping it's enough to get that raise or promotion (or at the very least, keep your position). 

Reviews are never a surprise. We generally know when they will start. We know what they will ask. We know we should spend more time on them. Yet we hit the same wall every time they show up. 

Let's talk about why this should change.
