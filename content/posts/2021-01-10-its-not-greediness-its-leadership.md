  There's a stigma around engineers that push for promotions and raises. Phrases
  like "greedy", "peter principle" and "business-minded" get thrown around
  pejoratively. I have a different take.

It was 10pm on a Sunday night. My performance self review was due to my manager in 2 hours. I hadn't written a single line. A voice inside me said "you messed up", but another voice (the one I liked a lot more) said "you do your job well, you'll be fine". Which of these two voices do you think ended up being right?

If you are a developer in any kind of corporate hierarchy, you're no stranger to performance reviews. We all do them a bit differently, but they all boil down to the same pieces: 

1. Try and remember at least half of the things you accomplished over the past x months. 

2. Do your best to shoe-horn those accomplishments into some provided framework of what success looks like at your position.

3. Cross your fingers and hit submit, hoping it's enough to get that raise or promotion. 

Reviews are never a surprise. We generally know when they will start. We know what they will ask. We know we should spend more time on them. Yet we hit the same wall every time they show up. 

We really should. But I know there are reasons why we do this. 

There can be some squeamishness about promotions and raises. People who constantly reach for them can be looked at as selfish "try hards", or worse (in the engineering industry) as "too business-y". But why? 

> _...This is a very random  aside. My personal theory is that the 2008 financial crises caused a fundamental shift in power from workers to corporations. This shift in power re-framed the American career as a gift, instead of a right. Gifts come from currying favor and can be taken away. Rights are assured. Thus we all wring our hands every six months, worrying if asking for a raise will be the straw that broke the camels back and we end up on the street. I digress..._

Here's a little secret - no one will fight for you if you don't fight for yourself. In my opinion, it's our duty to fight for every single penny we can get at every turn. It's not greed, its pathfinding. I'll use baseball players as a example. Every time a baseball player goes to negotiate a salary, they do so with every other baseball player in mind. The more they get, the higher the bar is for their skillset. If they negotiate well and get more money than before, they are now the rising tide that lifts all boats. A new precedent is set that their colleagues benefit from. 

Reaching for promotions and raises isn't a selfish act. It's
