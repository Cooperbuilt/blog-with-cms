It was 10pm on a Sunday night. My performance "self review" was due to my manager in 2 hours. I hadn't written a single line. A voice inside me said "you messed up...again", but another voice (the one I liked a lot more) said "you'll be fineeee". Which of these two voices do you think ended up being right?

If you are a developer in any kind of corporate hierarchy, you're no stranger to performance reviews. We all do them a bit differently, but they all boil down to the same pieces: 

1. Try and remember at least half of the things you accomplished over the past x months. 
2. Do your best to shoe-horn those accomplishments into some provided framework of what success looks like at your position.
3. Cross your fingers and hit submit, hoping it's enough to get that raise or promotion (or at the very least, keep your position). 

Reviews are never a surprise. We generally know when they will start. We know what they will ask. We know we should spend more time on them. Yet we hit the same wall every time they show up. 

Let's talk about why this should change. 

## Companies aren't designed to care about you

This isn't an anti-corporate America headline, it's a fact. Companies, at least publicly traded ones, have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to operate on the leanest budget possible. Most aren't actively trying to screw you or anything like that, but they definitely aren't in the business of throwing money at people that don't take the time to sell themselves. 

They will reward the high performers that do a great job of framing their accomplishments within the paradigms of the company's competencies. They will keep the status quo for the rest. 

## Managers aren't positioned to care more than you

I've had the great blessing of an excellent manager that cares about my career growth for more than 3 years now. Even with such a blessing, my manager can't pull a rabbit out of a hat. Even with my best interest at heart, he still needs me to deliver enough source material in my reviews to fight for money and promotions for me. 

Sure, you may be in the rare and privelged positiion of being so good that your manager fights for you no matter what you put in that performance review. This isn't likely. For the most part, they are holding on for dear life to get through reviews with their x+1 direct reports and need you to sell yourself well enough that they can just pass that on.
