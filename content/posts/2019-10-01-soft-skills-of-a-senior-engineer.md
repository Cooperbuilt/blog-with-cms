  The "senior" title for software engineers comes with some controversies. What
  makes one engineer "senior", and another "mid". I think the majority of the
  difference isn't technical, it's in the soft skills.


  I took a long-form article called "Being a senior engineer" by the wonderful
  Kitchen Soap blog and distilled it to include my experiences and thoughts.

## <span>Seek out Constructive Criticism of Your Work</span><span>.</span>

<span class="c9">Nothing is sacred, everything can be improved, ask your peers:</span>

1.  <span class="c2">“What could I be missing?”</span>
2.  <span class="c2">“How will this not work?”</span>
3.  <span class="c2">“Will you please shoot as many holes as possible into my thinking on this?”</span>
4.  <span class="c2">“Even if it’s technically sound, is it understandable enough for the rest of the organization to operate, troubleshoot, and extend it?”</span>

## <span>Strive for</span> <span>E</span><span class="c22 c23">mpathy</span>

<span class="c20">Be the engineer people</span> <span class="c1">want</span><span class="c20">to work with, not the engineer they</span> <span class="c1">have</span><span class="c5 c11"> to work with.</span>

<span class="c5 c11"></span>

1.  <span class="c22 c20 c27">Continually ask for a gut-check from peers and managers on how you are communicating.</span>
2.  <span class="c22 c20 c27">Aim to be assertive, not passive or aggressive</span>
3.  <span class="c22 c20 c27">Give and receive constructive criticism focused solely on the work, not the person.</span>
4.  <span class="c22 c20 c27">Receive critique with an open mind and open heart.</span>
5.  <span class="c9">Consider other goals and viewpoints when working on a project, for example Product Managers, Design, QA etc.</span>

<span class="c22 c18 c25"></span>

## <span>Embrace</span> <span>E</span><span class="c22 c23">stimates</span>

<span class="c9">Avoiding responsibility for estimates and deadlines is another way of saying, “I’m not ready to be relied upon for building critical pieces of infrastructure.”</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

## <span class="c22 c23">Follow Up: Estimate With Data</span>

<span>Estimates without data are prone to the</span> <span class="c21 c33">[planning fallacy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy&sa=D&ust=1569945282610000)</span><span>. Estimates should be based on prior velocity, risk factors, and project details. Build estimates in terms of best, medium, and worst case scenarios and be up front with your calculations for each case.</span>

## <span class="c5 c13">Stay Curious</span>

<span class="c20">Senior engineers are intellectually curious about</span> <span class="c18">everything</span><span class="c22 c20 c27">. They ask questions first, and seek out knowledge before forming opinions. They self-educate, go down “google-holes”, and always ask “how can I make this better”.</span>

## <span class="c22 c23">“Find a Broom”</span>

<span class="c5 c8">Jon Wooden was one of the most celebrated and successful basketball coaches in the history of college basketball. With all his money, fame, and power, guess what he was often seen doing in the middle of the week? Finding a broom and sweeping out his own gym.</span>

<span class="c22 c24"></span>

<span class="c22 c24">No matter how exciting or appealing a project is, there are always boring tasks that a less mature engineer may deem beneath their dignity or their job title.</span>

<span class="c5 c8"></span>

<span>Let no task be beneath you,</span> <span class="c5 c10">find your broom.</span>

## <span class="c5 c13">Teach Others</span>

<span class="c5 c10">TL;DR: Multiply.</span>

<span class="c5 c10"></span>

<span class="c2">Instead of: “I’ll just do it”, instead say “Let's work on this together”. Always look for teachable moments, and approach each of those moments with a generosity of spirit and a humble attitude.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c9">A senior engineer shifts their focus from individual contribution to</span> <span class="c0">multiplication.</span><span class="c2"> You can only write so much code, but through effective teaching, you multiply your abilities across many engineers, and they do the same.</span>

## <span class="c22 c23">Sponsor Many, Mentor Few</span>

<span class="c2">The tech industry is seriously challenged when it comes to supporting underrepresented and/or marginalized groups. When we see them, we have a tendency to want to mentor those groups. This assumes they aren’t already good enough for responsibility and/or leadership.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">People in these positions often need opportunity and visibility more than advice.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">A senior engineer looks for ways to sponsor their ascent into higher visibility roles.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">For example:</span>

*   <span class="c2">suggest someone who could be a good lead on a new project based on their experience in this codebase,</span>
*   <span class="c2">suggest someone be a postmortem facilitator, or another type of visible leader in a meeting where others are learning</span>
*   <span class="c2">suggest someone to give a talk at a company or team meeting in which they demonstrate their work</span>
*   <span class="c2">forward their email summary of a project to a different group of people than the original audience, underscoring why it was interesting or what you learned from it</span>
*   <span class="c2">ask someone’s manager if you can share feedback about some of their excellent work you witnessed</span>
*   <span class="c2">mention or share someone’s work in Slack that you thought was helpful, interesting, etc.</span>

## <span class="c5 c13">Cut Corners the Right Way</span>

<span class="c0">TL;DR</span><span class="c9">:</span> <span class="c5 c0">Everyone must cut corners, in every project. Do so with intent.</span>

<span class="c5 c0"></span>

<span class="c2">Immature engineers discover concessions in hindsight, disgusted. Mature engineers spell them out at the onset of a project, accept them, and recognize them as part of good engineering.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">All engineering decisions exist on an axis of optimality and brittleness. We solve problems on a spectrum from chronic to acute. Senior engineers make educated choices on this spectrum, and understand tech debt is an unavoidable part of development.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">When they do find bugs or refactorable software, they say “yep, we made it this far with it and knew we’d have to extend or change it at some point” instead of “I TOLD them this wouldn’t work!”.</span>

## <span class="c22 c23">Follow the Nine Commandments of Egoless Programming</span>

1.  <span class="c1">Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.</span><span class="c5 c11"> We can, and should, learn, laugh, and move on without playing the blame game.</span>
2.  <span class="c1">You are not your code.</span><span class="c20"> Remember that the entire point of a review is to find problems, don’t take it personally when a problem is uncovered.</span>
3.  <span class="c1">No matter how much “karate” you know, someone else will always know more.</span><span class="c22 c20 c27"> Such an individual can teach you some new moves if you ask. Seek and accept input from others, especially when you think it’s not needed.</span>
4.  <span class="c1">Don’t rewrite code without consultation.</span> <span class="c5 c11">There’s a fine line between “fixing code” and “rewriting code.” Know the difference, and pursue stylistic changes within the framework of a code review, not as a lone enforcer.</span>
5.  <span class="c1">Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.</span> <span class="c5 c11">Non-technical people who deal with developers on a regular basis almost universally hold the opinion that we are prima donnas at best and crybabies at worst. Don’t reinforce this stereotype with anger and impatience.</span>
6.  <span class="c1">The only constant in the world is change.</span><span class="c20"> Be open to it and accept it with a smile. Look at each change to your requirements, platform, or tool as a new challenge, rather than some serious inconvenience to be fought.</span>
7.  <span class="c1">Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat.</span><span class="c5 c11"> Never make your dearly departed idea a martyr or rallying cry.</span>
8.  <span class="c1">Don’t be “the coder in the corner.”</span><span class="c22 c20 c27"> Get involved in conversations, and be a participant in your office community.</span>
9.  <span class="c1">Critique code instead of people – be kind to the coder, not to the code.</span><span class="c5 c11"> As much as possible, make all of your comments positive and oriented to improving the code. Relate comments to local standards, program specs, increased performance, etc.</span>

<span class="c1">**In a larger organization this isn’t strictly true.</span>

## <span class="c22 c23">Don’t Care About Credit</span>

<span class="c9">Hold the success of the project much higher than the potential praise you may get personally for working on it</span><span class="c2">.***</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c9">***This is a fine line to walk - if you don’t self advocate you may have difficulty moving up in your career. Work to strike a balance between rightfully owning wins and seeking out credit as a rule.</span>
